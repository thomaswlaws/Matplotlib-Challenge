pymaceuticals
Pymaceuticals Inc., a fictional burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA, specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a fictional Chief Data Analyst, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this, the following have been created in the included Jupyter Notebook:

a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment
a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment
a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days
a horizontal bar graph version of the preceding bar graph. (Why? Because it looked a lot better, that's why)
Purpose
To demonstrate matplotlib plotting in Python/pandas.
